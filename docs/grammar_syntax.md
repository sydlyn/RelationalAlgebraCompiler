# Relational Algebra Compiler Syntax

## Overview

This is a **relational algebraâ€“focused** language for expressing queries over relational tables. All expressions must be wrapped in parentheses.

- `{}` is used to enclose **subscripts**, such as attribute lists or conditions.
- The `^d` suffix on operations (e.g., `\pi^d`, `\union^d`) indicates **bag semantics**, meaning duplicates are preserved rather than removed.
- Multiple aliases are supported for many operations to accommodate different styles (e.g., `\sigma`, `\selection`, `\select` all perform selection).
- Keywords are not case sensitive.
- Queries can be nested by placing one expression inside another: `(\pi{...} (\selection{...} Table))`



## Supported Operations

- Unary Operations: 
    - [Projection](#projection)
    - [Selection](#selection)

    - [Union](#union)
    - [Intersection](#intersection)

**Notes on Operation Types**

- Unary operations: operate on a **single table**.
- Set operations: combine **two tables with the same schema**.
- Merge operations: combine **two tables**, typically on related keys or conditions.

## Unary Operations

### Projection

Selects specific attributes, optionally renaming them or computing derived values. Supports bag semantics (^d).

**Valid Keywords Variations**:
- set semantics: `\projection`, `\pi`
- bag semantics: `\projection^d`, `\pi^d`

**Syntax options**:
```
(\pi{name, age} Students)
(\projection{name, age} Students)
(\pi^d{name, age} Students)         ; keeps duplicates
(\pi{name + 2 -> agePlus2} Students)
(\projection{name -> fullName} Students)
```

**Explanation**:
- Returns a table with only the specified attributes.
- `->` can be used to rename attributes or give aliases to expressions.
- `^d` means **"don't remove duplicates"**, i.e., use bag semantics instead of set semantics.

---

### Selection

Filters rows based on a condition.

**Valid Keywords Variations**: `\selection`, `\select`, `\sigma`

**Syntax options**:
```
(\sigma {age > 30} Students)
(\selection{age > 30, gpa=4.0} Students)
(\select{name = "Alice"} Employees)
```

**Explanation**: 
- Keeps only the rows from the input table that satisfy the given condition.
- If the condition evaluates to True, it will return every row. Similarly, if the condition evaluates to False, it will return no rows.

---

### Group By and Aggregation

Groups rows by one or more attributes and applies aggregate functions (e.g., `sum`, `count`, `avg`, etc.).

**Valid Keywords Variations**: `\group_by`, `\group`, `\gamma`

**Syntax options**:
```
(\group{dept; count(*), avg(salary)} Employees)
(\group_by{name; sum(score)} Results)
(\gamma{category; max(price)} Products)
```

**Explanation**:
- The part before the `;` specifies the group-by attributes.
- The part after the `;` contains aggregation expressions.
- Aggregates can include `count`, `sum`, `avg`, `min`, and `max`.
    - `count(*)` can be used to count all unique grouped-by rows

---

### Rename

Renames the result of a table or subquery.

**Valid Keywords Variations**: `\rename`, `\rho`

**Syntax options**:
```
(\rename{RenamedTable} Students)
(\rho{X} (\selection{age > 20} Students))
```

**Explanation**: Changes the name of the relation for use in further operations.

---

### Remove Duplicates

Removes duplicate rows from a relation.

**Valid Keywords Variations**: `\remove_duplicates`, `\remove_dups`, `\delta`

**Syntax options**:
```
(\remove_duplicates Students)
(\remove_dups (\pi{name} Employees))
(\delta (\projection{name} Employees))
```

**Explanation**: Enforces set semantics explicitly by discarding repeated rows.

---

### Sort

Sorts rows by specified attributes in ascending or descending order.

**Valid Keywords Variations**: `\sort`, `\order`, `\tau`

**Syntax options**:
```
(\sort{name asc} Students)
(\order{dept desc, age asc} Employees)
(\tau{salary desc} Employees)
```

**Explanation**: Orders the rows based on one or more attributes and directions. Valid directions are `asc` (ascending) and `desc` (descending).

---

## Set Operations

### Union

Combines rows from two relations. Supports bag semantics (^d).

**Valid Keywords Variations**:
- set semantics: `\union`, `\u`
- bag semantics: `\union^d`, `\u^d`

**Syntax options**:
```
(Students \union Graduates)
(Students \u^d Alumni)
```

**Explanation**:
- Combines all rows from both inputs.
- `\union` removes duplicates (set semantics).
- `\union^d` keeps duplicates (bag semantics).

---

### Intersection

Returns only the rows that appear in **both** relations. Supports bag semantics (^d).

**Valid Keywords Variations**:
- set semantics: `\intersect`, `\inter`
- bag semantics: `\intersect^d`, `\inter^d`

**Syntax options**:
```
(Students \inter Graduates)
(Employees \intersect^d Contractors)
```

**Explanation**:
- Keeps rows that appear in **both** inputs.
- `^d` variant preserves the frequency from the inputs.

---

### Difference

Returns rows in the first relation that **do not appear** in the second. Supports bag semantics (^d).

**Valid Keywords Variations**:
- set semantics: `\difference`, `\diff`, `\subtract`
- bag semantics: `\difference^d`, `\diff^d`, `\subtract^d`

**Syntax options**:
```
(Students \diff Dropouts)
(Employees \difference^d FormerEmployees)
```

**Explanation**:
- Performs set subtraction.
- `^d` variant uses bag-based subtraction.

---

## Merge Operations

### Cross Product

Produces the Cartesian product of two relations.

**Valid Keywords Variations**: `\cross_product`, `\cross`, `\x`

**Syntax options**:
```
(Students \x Courses)
(Employees \cross_product Departments)
```

**Explanation**: Every row in the first relation is paired with every row in the second.

---

### Joins

Combines rows from two tables based on a condition or join type.

**Valid Keywords Variations**: 
- Inner Join: 
    - `\j`, `\join`
    - `\inner`, `\inner_j`, `\inner_join`

- Inner\Semi Left Join:
    - `\semi`, `\semi_j`, `\semi_join`
    - `\left_semi`, `\left_semi_j`, `\left_semi_join`

- Inner\Semi Right Join:
    - `\right_semi`, `\right_semi_j`, `\right_semi_join`

- Full Outer Join: 
    - `\full`, `\full_j`, `\full_join`
    - `\full_outer`, `\full_outer_j`, `\full_outer_join`
    - `\outer`, `\outer_j`, `\outer_join`

- Left Outer Join: 
    - `\left`, `\left_j`, `\left_join`
    - `\left_outer`, `\left_outer_j`, `\left_outer_join`

- Right Outer Join
    - `\right`, `\right_j`, `\right_join`
    - `\right_outer`, `\right_outer_j`, `\right_outer_join`


**Syntax options**:
```
(Students \join{name = advisor} Professors)
(Students \inner_join Professors)
(Students \left_join Professors)
(Students \right_outer{name = id} Advisors)
(Students \semi{name = advisor} Professors)
```

**Supported Join Types**:
- Inner Join
- Left/Right Semi Joins
- Full Outer Join
- Left/Right Outer Joins


**Explanation**:
- Can be used with or without join conditions.
- Conditions go inside `{}` (e.g., `{Students.name = Professors.advisor}`).
- Semi-joins return rows only from the left table that match the condition.

---

### Divide

Implements relational division: useful for queries like "Find students who are enrolled in **all** courses".

**Valid Keywords Variations**: `\divide`, `\div`

**Syntax options**:
```
(Enrolled \divide Courses)
(Enrollment \div RequiredCourses)
```

**Explanation**: Returns rows from the first table that are associated with **all** rows in the second.

---

## Example Combined Expression

```
(\pi{name, avgSalary}
  (\group{dept; avg(salary) -> avgSalary}
    (\selection{age > 30} Employees)))
```

**Explanation**:
- Filters employees older than 30.
- Groups them by department.
- Computes the average salary per department.
- Projects just the name and computed average salary (aliased as `avgSalary`).
